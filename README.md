# Read all my emails

I have to many unread old emails. So I made this script to do it for me instead.
You need a json file from your google account with tokens from gmail api with gmail modify scope,
and name the json file credentials.json.

How to install and run:

```zsh
conda create --read-my-emails python=3.12```
```zsh
conda activate read-my-emails```
```zsh
conda install pip```
```zsh
pip -r install requirements.txt```
```zsh
python read-emails.py```
