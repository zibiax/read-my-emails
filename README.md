# Read all my emails

I have to many unread old emails. So I made this script to do it for me instead.
You need a json file from your google account with tokens from gmail api with gmail modify scope,
and name the json file credentials.json.

How to install and run:
´´´conda env create -f environment.yml´´´
´´´python read-emails.py```
